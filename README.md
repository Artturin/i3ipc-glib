# i3-ipc

An improved dynamic i3 ipc.

**Note:** i3-ipc is in the early stages of development and many things are likely to change.

## About i3-ipc

i3's *interprocess communication* (or [ipc](http://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html)) is the interface [i3wm](http://i3wm.org) uses to receive [commands](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_list_of_commands) from client applications such as `i3-msg`. It also features a publish/subscribe mechanism for notifying interested parties of window manager events.

i3-ipc is a library to communicate with i3 via the ipc. The project is written in C and exposes bindings to various high-level programming languages such as Python, Perl, Lua, Ruby, and JavaScript. This is possible through the use of Gnome's [GObject Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GObjectIntrospection?action=show&redirect=GObjectIntrospection) library and utilities.

The goal of this project is to provide a basis for new projects in higher level languages for general scripting as well as an interface to i3 that fits well within a GLib-based stack.

## Installation

Installation requires [autotools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system). Run `autogen.sh` to generate the files required for building and begin configuring the project. Then call `make` and the library will build in the `i3ipc` directory.

The following packages are required for building i3-ipc:

* libxcb and xcb-proto (the requirements for i3 itself should be ok).
* glib >= 2.38
* json-glib >= 0.16
* gobject-introspection >= 1.38 (for language bindings)

To use the bindings, set the following environment variables:

    export GI_TYPELIB_PATH=/path/to/i3-ipc/i3ipc
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/i3-ipc/i3ipc/.libs:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

This should be sufficient for creating a development environment for working on the project.

## Example

Here is an example use of the library with the Python bindings.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from gi.repository import i3ipc
from gi.repository.GLib import MainLoop

# Create the Connection object that can be used to send commands and subscribe
# to events.
ipc = i3ipc.Connection()

# Query the ipc for outputs. The result is a list that represents the parsed
# reply of a command like `i3-msg -t get_outputs`.
outputs = ipc.get_outputs()

print('Active outputs:')

for output in filter(lambda o: o.active, outputs):
    print(output.name)

# Send a command to be executed synchronously.
ipc.command('focus left')

# Define a callback to be called when you switch workspaces.
def on_workspace(self, e):
    # The first parameter is the connection to the ipc and the second is an object
    # with the data of the event sent from i3.
    if (e.current):
        print('Windows on this workspace:')
        for w in e.current.get_nodes():
            print(w.props.name)

# Subscribe to the workspace event
ipc.on('workspace', on_workspace)

# Start the main loop and wait for events to come in.
main = MainLoop()
main.run()
main.unref()
```

The library exposes the same API to many other scripting languages as well.
